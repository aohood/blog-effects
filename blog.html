            it doesnot harm anybody to write them for the years.</p>
            <p class="organize">In fact, I think that I should write down my thoughts for many reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Say your word before it dies, it will deffenitely know its way.</li>
                <li>To track the changes that happend to my mind through the years,
                  and as a picture shouw you what happend to your face, a thought will show you what happend to your brain.</li>
                <li>If I have a spisific concern and I think I should say it, it could target someone who may make a change!</li>
                <li>Thoughts are always a treasure, if not for today, they will be tomorrow.</li>
